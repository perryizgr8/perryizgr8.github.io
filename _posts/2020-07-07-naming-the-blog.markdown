After a few hours of thinking and asking a couple of people I know, I came up with the name of this blog.

Acquire and Release semantics is an area of study that has always intrigued me, but one I've never properly understood. I also like that this blog is where I can release random info that I have acquired. Two bad reasons should be good enough for a name!
