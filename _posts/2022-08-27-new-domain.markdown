title:  "New domain for the blog!"

I've been experimenting with setting up a self-hosted Google Photos alternative (since they ended the free upload offer), and came across CloudFlare's domain service. Their prices are really low compared to others, especially for `.com`.

So I moved this blog over to [blog.perryizgr8.com](blog.perryizgr8.com). I plan to use this domain for my email in the future too, otherwise I'll be forever tied to Gmail and Outlook.
