title:  "I made an inflation calculator for ₹ (Indian Rupees)"

I've always wanted to know the answer to the kind of question: How much would ₹X be worth n years later, if you account only for inflation. While there are many good calculators that do this for $, I could not find a good one for ₹.

I wanted it to be a dead simple page, kind of like [this one](http://www.adjustforinflation.com). Although I had the idea in my mind for a long time, it was yesterday that I finally made myself sit and make it.

So [here](https://perryizgr8.github.io/adjust-for-inflation/) it is. Hope it is interesting/fun for someone.

PS: I took the coefficients from OECD CPI database. I wanted to use official Central Government data but I could not figure out how to extract it from the [official website](http://mospi.nic.in/cpi).
